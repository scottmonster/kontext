#### DISCLAIMER:

I'm not a programmer, software developer, engineer, or any other fancy title that sounds like I speak fluent binary. I am not a network engineer. I do not even have any sort of IT or tech job. I am simply a hobbyist who dabbles in code to fix relatively minor issues and annoyances. Most of the time, I throw what little I know about "good" coding standards out the window and beat my head against the wall just trying to get the thing to work. To highlight some of my key skills:

- **Memory Management**: The only thing I know about pointers is that they can be used to identify where the fire has started after I inevitably create one of my signature infinite loops. Because I lack memory management skills, I rely heavily on the far superior and quicker (Garbage Collected) languages, especially the GOAT... JavaScript.
- **Debugging**: I have exceptional and unmatched debugging skills... ugly cry while button mashing until I accidentally fix the problem.
- **Scalability**: I don't need to worry about scalability issues because I highly doubt any more than three people will ever use something I write.
- **Dependency Management**: `rm -rf node_modules`
- **Recursion**: You can recursively drag these balls across your face.
- **Version Control Conflicts**: Please see the "Dependency Management" section and apply similar techniques.
- **Security Concerns**: I adhere to strict safety protocols by ensuring the proper use of PPE, including flame-resistant attire, a fire extinguisher, and a respirator, before running the code I write. Furthermore, I continually review, update, and practice evacuation procedures to maintain a secure environment.

Self-deprecating jokes aside, I know I do not write the cleanest, most efficient, or safest code. Sometimes it's because the task doesn't require it and sometimes it's because I don't know how. I am always interested in learning, though. So if you happen to come across this and want to learn me some education or you simply want to use something that I've mangled together, feel free to refactor some of my code.

Thank you,

As is. Run at your own risk. I'm not accountable for your poor judgment. You've been warned.

# kontext

Aims to be a program that will dynamically display different markdown files based on the active window.

I use a lot of programs that are driven by keyboard shortcuts. The normal workfow is: lookup the shortcut > use the shortcut > forget the shortcut > wait until I need the shortcut again... wash, rinse, repeat. I'm creating this to hopefully aid in memorizing the shortcuts that I don't have memorized already.

The idea is to be able to quickly and easily create a markdown file for different programs (I should probably add the ability to filter the window title as well). That markdown file would contain a table to add or remove shortcuts as needed. When the active window changes, check for the applicable markdown file and display it if one is found.

### Status

Dumpster fire. Do not use.
I started working on it a couple of months ago, and then got real busy. I do intend on starting to work on it again soon.
